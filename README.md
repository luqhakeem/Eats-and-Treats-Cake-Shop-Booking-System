# Eats-and-Treats-Cake-Shop-Booking-System
Eats and Treats Cake Shop is taking order from their customers manually by jotting it down in a notebook – either the customer walk into their shop or calling them to drop their order. This method has shown drawbacks on several cases such as some customer’s order got mixed up by the staffs, some orders got dropped out during processing the orders, or the staffs simply forgot to write the order down in their notebook. Eats and Treats Cake Shop has received some bad reviews from their customers for this clumsy error. Furthermore, the notebooks have piled up after years of the shop’s operation as a notebook has limited pages available and are bound to be filled up when it’s used daily. All the notebooks have taken up a great deal of space in the shop’s storeroom to this day. Other than that, with all the notebooks, it is difficult to access data when needed. The owner of the Eats and Treats Cake Shop has decided it is time to stop using the traditional method of storing all the data and wish to upgrade using a website and a Database Management System (DBMS) in order to make their workflow smoother and serve their customers better.
