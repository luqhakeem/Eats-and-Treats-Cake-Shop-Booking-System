                        <p>This document contains the software development plan of Cake shop online ordering system. The Software Development Plan (SDP) is significant to the clients, stakeholders and any parties involved as it will make it easy to communicate to each others and describe the approach to the development of this project. In the first part of this document, it describe the purpose and the scope of having a SDP. The second part of the document, present the assumptions and constraints by assuming what will happen when the system is developed and also the list of all major items to be delivered or the end product to be created during the project. While in the third part of this document is about the project organization by describing the organization structure of the project team and also the responsible that for each member of the core workflows, workflow details, and supporting processes. Finally, in the final part it will describe about the management process such as the project schedule to show the target dates for completing every phases, project resourcing to identify the numbers and type of staff required and the budget for allocating the costs.<br><br>Currently, the Eats and Treats Cake Shop is taking order from their customers manually by jotting it down in a notebook – either the customer walk into their shop or calling them to drop their order. This method has shown drawbacks on several cases such as some customer’s order got mixed up by the staffs, some orders got dropped out during processing the orders, or the staffs simply forgot to write the order down in their notebook. Eats and Treats Cake Shop has received some bad reviews from their customers for this clumsy error. Furthermore, the notebooks have piled up after years of the shop’s operation as a notebook has limited pages available and are bound to be filled up when it’s used daily. All the notebooks have taken up a great deal of space in the shop’s storeroom to this day. Other than that, with all the notebooks, it is difficult to access data when needed. The owner of the Eats and Treats Cake Shop has decided it is time to stop using the traditional method of storing all the data and wish to upgrade using a website and a Database Management System (DBMS) in order to make their workflow smoother and serve their customers better.<br></p>
